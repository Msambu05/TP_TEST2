    "# Linear search\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear search is like looking for something by checking every item one by one, e.g. It works fine if you have a small phone book, but if you have a very big phone book, it might take a long time because you have to look through every single name.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Binary Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary search is like a smarter way of looking for something by dividing the search area in half each time, is much faster, especially for large phone books, because you're cutting down the search space by half with each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "Binary search is faster for large datasets, but it requires the data to be sorted beforehand, which adds a bit of extra work upfront. So, the choice between linear and binary search depends on how big the dataset is, whether it's sorted, and how quickly you need to find things.\n"
